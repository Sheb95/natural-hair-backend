#Natural Hair API
##Context
This project started as a way to practice creating a server with express with multiple routes. However, once I had completed the first iteration of this, I decided to deploy this to AWS using AWS CDK and Lambda. 

I choose to use AWS CDK to get my first taste of infrastructure as code (IaC). Through AWS CDK, I defined the configuration of my Lambda function which was then used to deploy my REST API. 

I thought that my simple application would be an interesting way to become acquainted with this as well as AWS's microservices. 

1st iteration: Express server with CRUD routes running on the computer [DONE]
2nd iteration: Express server deployed on AWS using Lambda and AWS CDK [DONE]
3rd iteration: migrate data from data.js to PostgreSQL (AWS RDS) [IN PROGRESS]
